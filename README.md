Web Applications with Spring Boot & Vaadin.


The example application used is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system for managing contacts. It has a few features:

    Log-in screen to restrict access.

    Responsive layout with side navigation that works on desktop and mobile.

    Database for persistent data storage.

    List view that can be sorted and filtered.

    Form to edit and add contacts.

    Dashboard view.

    Cloud deployment.

    Application installation on mobile and desktop.
Tools & Frameworks:


    Dependency injection to decouple components;

    Spring Data JPA repositories to work with the database;

    Spring Security to handle access control;

    An embedded Tomcat server to serve the application; and

    Spring Boot Developer Tools to provide a smoother development experience.


On the frontend, the application uses Vaadin Flow. Vaadin Flow is an open source Java web application framework that comes with a few key elements:

    A large library of UI components. Each component has a Java API that you can customize for a look-and-feel you prefer.

    A router for navigating between views.

    A powerful data-binding system for forms and lists.
